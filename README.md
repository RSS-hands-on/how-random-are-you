# Royal Statistical Society Hands-on Activities: How random are you?

## What is here?

This Github repository contains files for running the "How
random are you?" activity. Specifically:

+ Browser-based App (how_random.html),
+ Instruction sheet (How_Random_Are_You.pdf).

Additionally, you may also be interested in:

+ A YouTube video demonstrating the activity **(link to be made active
September 2017)**

**NOTE:** Github does not easily allow downloads of single files, as
  such use the green "Clone or download" button to download a ZIP file
  containing the above.

### Browser-based App instructions

The App will work in any web-browser with Javascript enabled, it is
written using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) (a well-established
Javascript framework).

Simply download the single file [how_random.html](how_random.html) on
to your computer or device and open it with a
web-browser. 

**Note:** the default web-browser on some mobile devices and tablets disables
key Javascript features that mean the App will not work. The App has
been tested:
+ using Google Chrome for Android on a range of Samsung
tablets,
+ on desktop computers running Windows,
+ on desktop computers running Linux.
